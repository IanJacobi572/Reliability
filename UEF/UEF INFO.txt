TIN TOUT TEMP = 5sec after draw start until draw end


Mi = Total Water Drawn {m}

//Cpi= Tdelta+Tin/2

Average temp = (Delivery water temp(Tout)+ Supply water temp(Tin)) /2

Cpi = average temp => CPi from sheet3

Tdelta = Delivery water temp - Supply water temp

Qr=Gas Consumption*Higher heating value*Correction factor + Power Consumption(WattHrs)*3.412
PS: Qr parameters are the average of the first draw!!!

Correction factor = ((Gas pressure*0.0735)+Barometer)*520/(30*(460+Gas Temperature))

Recovery Efficiency = (M1*Cp1*Tdelta1)  / Qr


Qhw=sum(Mi*Cpi*Tdeltai)/recovery efficiency
sum: from i=1 to N

Qhw67=sum(Mi*Cpi*67)/recovery efficiency

Qhwd = Qhw67 - Qhw

Qe = max(WattHrs)
Qf = same as Qr but for 24hrs
Qd = Qf + Qe

Qdm = Qd + Qhwd




UEF = sum(Mi*Cpi*67)/Qdm
sum: from i=1 to N


hhv: Get Higher heating value from Variables folder
Mi: Water mass
Gas Consumptopm: Gas ascf

Before the test start there's generally 1hr wait, the way to know how long was the wait is to check the Tout temp
Tin should be 58 +-2, 5sec after draw start 
Use Purge valve instead of events because they shouldn't happend at the same time, it's purge draw purge draw..
after 30sec of draw complete check the burner 
between 4th and 5th draw, if the gas valve is open for a long time then there could be a gas leak (gas ascf)
barometer and weather correlation (high barometer is warm, low is stormy)
after draw complete, calculate time before cut out (should be around 30sec)
compare power input (get it from report or .sm files) with Qr/time of 1st draw (hrs)
