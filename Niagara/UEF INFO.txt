Mi = Total Water Drawn {m}

//Cpi= Tdelta+Tin/2

Average temp = (Delivery water temp(Tout)+ Supply water temp(Tin)) /2

Cpi = average temp => CPi from sheet3

Tdelta = Delivery water temp - Supply water temp

Qr=Gas Consumption*Higher heating value*Correction factor + Power Consumption(WattHrs)*3.412
PS: Qr parameters are the average of the first draw!!!

Correction factor = ((Gas pressure*0.0735)+Barometer)*520/(30*(460+Gas Temperature))

Recovery Efficiency = (M1*Cp1*Tdelta1)  / Qr


Qhw=sum(Mi*Cpi*Tdeltai)/recovery efficiency
sum: from i=1 to N

Qhw67=sum(Mi*Cpi*67)/recovery efficiency

Qhwd = Qhw67 - Qhw

Qe = max(WattHrs)
Qf = same as Qr but for 24hrs
Qd = Qf + Qe

Qdm = Qd + Qhwd




UEF = sum(Mi*Cpi*67)/Qdm
sum: from i=1 to N
